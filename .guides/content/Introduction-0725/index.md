## Codio Debugger Guide

Welcome to the **Debugger Guide**! This guide provides a comprehensive overview of how to use Codio's built-in debugger across multiple programming languages, along with step-by-step instructions for common debugging tasks.

The debugger menu is the right most menu item. If you click on the down arrow you can start the debugger for those languages. Debug configurations can be added using the 'Configure...' menu item.

### What You'll Learn:
In this guide, we will cover a range of debugging techniques and features, including:

- **Setting and Managing Breakpoints**: Learn how to pause program execution at key points and inspect variable values.
- **Watch Expressions**: Monitor the values of specific variables throughout the execution of your program.
- **Step Over, Step Into, and Step Out**: Master different ways to navigate through code execution line by line or function by function.
- **Using the Console**: View logs, warnings, errors, and program output while debugging.
- **Configuring Debugger Targets**: Set up custom debugger configurations for different languages, including passing command-line arguments.


### Languages Covered:
This guide includes detailed examples in the following supported programming languages:

- **Python**
- **C++**
- **C**
- **Node.js**
- **Java**


Each section contains code examples, debugger configurations, and guided exercises to help you understand and practice debugging in your chosen language.

Feel free to modify this project.
