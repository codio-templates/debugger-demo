### 1. Step Into

- **What it Does**: When you use "Step Into," the debugger will go into the next line of code that is to be executed. If this line is a function call, the debugger will enter that function and stop at the first line inside it.
- **When to Use**: This is used when you want to examine the behavior inside a function call or if you're investigating a specific function and need to see how it executes line by line.
- **Example**: If your current line in the debugger is a call to `atoi(argv[1])`, using "Step Into" will take you into the `atoi` function (if its definition is accessible in your debugging environment), allowing you to see how `atoi` is converting the string to an integer.

### 2. Step Over

- **What it Does**: "Step Over" also moves to the next line of code, but it treats function calls differently. If the next line contains a function call, the debugger will execute the entire function call as one atomic step and pause at the next line after the function call.
- **When to Use**: This is useful when you are not interested in the inner workings of a function but just want to see the effects of the function call. It allows you to skip over the details of the function's implementation.
- **Example**: Continuing with the `atoi(argv[1])` example, if you "Step Over" this line, the debugger will execute the `atoi` function, assign its return value to `num1`, and then pause on the next line of your code. You won't see the internal execution of `atoi`.

### Summary

In simple terms, "Step Into" is like saying, "I want to see what's happening inside this function," while "Step Over" is like saying, "I'm okay with this function doing its thing; let me see what happens after it's done." 

Choosing between these two often depends on the level of detail you need. If you're debugging your own function or suspect a bug inside a particular function, "Step Into" is the way to go. If you're confident the function works correctly or it's a standard library function that you trust, you might prefer "Step Over" to avoid getting bogged down in unnecessary details.
