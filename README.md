#Â Debugger Demo
This project shows how to use the Codio debugger. This provides in browser visual debugging for 

- Java
- C
- C++
- NodeJS
- Python

It is possible to add support for other languages upon request, so please contact support@codio.com if you are interested.

### Documentation
[Click here](https://codio.com/docs/ide/features/debugging/) to access the Codio documentation for the debugger.

### This demo
In the filetree you will find some very simple projects for the supported languages. 

The debugger menu is the right most menu item. If you click on the down arrow you can start the debugger for those languages. You should note that debug configurations can be added using the 'Configure...' menu item.

It is also possible to add multiple debugger configurations for the same code. If, for example, you wanted to test different argument values then you can create one confguration for each set of values, changing the Arguments field as required.

Feel free to modify this project.
